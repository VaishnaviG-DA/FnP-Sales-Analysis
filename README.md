# 🛍️FnP Sales Analysis using MS Excel and PowerQuery
Analyzing Annual Sales of FnP - Excel Dashboard

# 📌 Project Description
This project is an end-to-end sales performance analysis for FnP, a gifting and e-commerce platform. The goal was to uncover revenue patterns, seasonal trends, category performance, and city-wise sales strengths to guide future business strategies. The dataset contained transactional details including product categories, order dates, delivery times, and revenue figures. Using Excel, the data was cleaned, processed, and transformed into an interactive dashboard to provide actionable business insights. The analysis revealed seasonal peaks in February and August, time-of-day order spikes around mid-morning and evening, and regional hotspots driving revenue. These findings help FnP optimize marketing campaigns, stock management, and operational efficiency.
